# Example: DS18B20 temperature sensor with Pico

This example shows how to use the DS18B20 temperature sensor with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

> [!NOTE]  
> This crate is dependent on `embedded-hal:1.0`. This example is dependent on
> cortex-m which - at the time of writing - is not yet compatible with `embedded-hal:1.0`. Therefore, this example
> will not work out of the box until `cortex-m` is updated to be compatible with `embedded-hal:1.0`.
> A pull request is already merged in the cortex-m repository, so it should be available soon.
> Though, you can still use this example by using the `main` branch of the `cortex-m` repository.
